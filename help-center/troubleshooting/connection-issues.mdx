description: How to fix connection problems with your GPUniq GPU rental.

## Problem

- SSH connection times out
- "Connection refused" error
- Can't reach the GPU after renting

## Quick Diagnosis

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Instance Status">
    Go to **My Instances** in your dashboard.
    
    Verify your instance shows **Running** status.
    
    If it shows "Stopped" or "Error", the connection won't work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify SSH Details">
    Double-check you're using the exact credentials from your dashboard:
    - **Host**: The IP address or hostname
    - **Port**: The specific SSH port (often not 22)
    - **Password**: The generated password (copy-paste to avoid typos)
    
    ```bash
    ssh root@{host} -p {port}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Your Network">
    Ensure your network allows outbound SSH connections.
    
    Some corporate/school networks block non-standard ports.
    
    Try from a different network or use a VPN.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait a Moment">
    New instances may take 30-60 seconds to fully initialize.
    
    If you just rented, wait a minute and try again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Fixes

### Instance Stuck

If your instance shows "Running" but won't connect:

1. Click **Stop** on the instance
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Click **Start** to restart
4. Try connecting again with new credentials

### Port Blocked

If connection times out (not refused):

```bash
# Test if port is reachable
nc -zv {host} {port}
```

If this fails, your network may be blocking the port. Try:
- Using a different network
- Connecting via VPN
- Contacting your IT department

### Password Issues

Passwords are case-sensitive and may contain special characters.

**Best practice**: Copy the password directly from the dashboard rather than typing it.

If using a terminal that interprets special characters:

```bash
# Use quotes around password if prompted
ssh root@{host} -p {port}
Password: "your_password_here"
```

## Still Having Issues?

### Restart the Rental

1. Delete the current instance
2. Rent the same GPU again
3. Fresh instances often resolve mysterious issues

### Try a Different GPU

If one provider's GPU won't connect, try renting from a different provider. Look for:
- **Verified** badge (indicates tested reliability)
- Higher **reliability score**

### Contact Support

If nothing works:

1. Note your **Task ID** from the dashboard
2. Email [support@gpuniq.com](mailto:support@gpuniq.com) with:
   - Task ID
   - Error message (screenshot if possible)
   - What you've already tried
3. Or reach out on [Telegram](https://t.me/gpuniq) for faster response
