<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Auto-Switching" icon="settings">
    In your dashboard, toggle `autoSwitch` to `true`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Rules" icon="sliders">
    Set thresholds: `minVRAM: "24GB"`, `maxTFLOPS: 50`.

## Snapshot Functionality

Snapshots capture your GPU instance state, including data and models, for quick restoration. Preserve progress without full recreation.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Create Snapshot" icon="camera">
````bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/snapshots \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "instanceId": "gpu-12345",
    "name": "model-training-v1"
  }'
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Restore Snapshot" icon="refresh-cw">
````bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/instances \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "snapshotId": "snap-67890",
    "gpuType": "A100"
  }'
````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Expandable title="Advanced Snapshot Options" default-open="false">
  Use tags for organization: `tags: {["ai-training", "v1.2"]}`. Retain up to 50 snapshots per account.
</Expandable>

## Cost-Saving Mechanisms

GPUiq delivers up to 70% savings through on-demand pricing, reserved instances, and spot markets. Pay only for active usage with automatic shutdowns.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,Dashboard">
````bash
# CLI: List pricing
gpuiq pricing list --region us-east
````

```javascript
// JS SDK
const pricing = await gpuiq.pricing.list({ region: 'us-east' });
console.log(pricing.spot.a100); // $0.50/hour
```
</CodeGroup>

| Model | Hourly Rate (A100) | Savings |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| On-Demand | $1.20 | Baseline |
| Reserved (1yr) | $0.72 | 40% |
| Spot | $0.36 | 70% |

<Callout kind="tip">
  Combine spot instances with snapshots for maximum savings on interruptible workloads.
